MultiChat PDF: Intelligent PDF-based Conversation Assistant

The MultiChat PDF is a powerful Python-based application that enables seamless natural language interactions with multiple PDF documents. Users can ask questions about the contents of the loaded PDFs, and the application will provide relevant responses by leveraging advanced language modeling techniques.

Key Features:
- Supports multiple PDF documents as input
- Extracts and processes text content from PDFs
- Utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text
- Performs semantic search to identify the most relevant content for a given user query
- Generates accurate and informative responses based on the PDF content

How It Works:
1. PDF Loading: The application reads and stores the content of multiple PDF documents.
2. Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
3. Embedding Generation: A language model is used to create vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks, capturing their semantic meaning.
4. Semantic Search: When a user asks a question, the application compares the query with the text chunk embeddings to identify the most relevant content.
5. Response Generation: The selected relevant chunks are passed back through the language model to generate a meaningful and informative response for the user.

This application is designed to provide users with a seamless and intelligent interface to explore and interact with the information contained within PDF documents. Whether you're conducting research, reviewing reports, or simply seeking answers, the MultiChat PDF is a powerful tool to enhance your productivity and knowledge discovery.
